# Rust Web Server

Implement a web server that provides a shopping list. Using web requests,
users can add items to the shopping list, modify items and delete items.

Items in the shopping list are represented by a title, number of items and a price.

Storing items is done using in in-memory database (an array of type `Vec` is enough).
